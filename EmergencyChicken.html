    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is a great recipe for a quick and easy entree. My wife, who is 8 1/2 months pregnant, had chicken thawing and asked me to cook since she was exhausted. She didn't have any plans so I just threw some things together and came up with this recipe. I'm sure it could be improved upon, but in a pinch it was easy and delicious.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2/3 cup barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2/3 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken pieces - cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir barbeque sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder together with the melted butter. Stir chicken into the sauce mixture to coat.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place cover on saucepan and simmer until the chicken pieces are cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove cover and spoon sauce over chicken pieces; continue cooking until sauce thickens, about 4 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
